    <h2>
      I

    <p>
      Like a man who reenters a closed and darkened house and lies down; lying
      there, remains conscious of sunlight outside, of bird-calls, and the
      breeze in the trees, so had Drene entered into the obscurity of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the chambers of his brain the twilit corridors where cringed his
      bruised and disfigured soul, there nothing stirring except the automatic
      pulses which never cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, when the sky itself crashes earthward and the world lies in
      ruins from horizon to horizon, life goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The things that men live through&mdash;and live!
    </p>
    <p>
      But no doubt Death was too busy elsewhere to attend to Drene.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had become very lean by the time it was all over. Gray glinted on his
      temples; gray softened his sandy mustache: youth was finished as far as he
      was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd idea persisted in his mind that it had been winter for many years.
      And the world thawed out very slowly for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But broken trees leaf out, and hewed roots sprout; and what he had so long
      mistaken for wintry ashes now gleamed warmly like the orange and gold of
      early autumn. After a while he began to go about more or less&mdash;little
      excursions from the dim privacy of mind and soul&mdash;and he found the
      sun not very gray; and a south wind blowing in the world once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quair and Guilder were in the studio that day on business; Drene continued
      to modify his composition in accordance with Guilder's suggestions; Quair,
      always curious concerning Drene, was becoming slyly impudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And listen to me, Guilder. What the devil's a woman between friends?"
      argued Quair, with a malicious side glance at Drene. "You take my best
      girl away from me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't," remarked his partner dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the sake of argument, you do. What happens? Do I raise hell? No. I
      merely thank you. Why? Because I don't want her if you can get her away.
      That," he added, with satisfaction, "is philosophy. Isn't it, Drene?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Guilder intervened pleasantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think Drene is particularly interested in philosophy. I'm sure
      I'm not. Shut up, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene, gravely annoyed, continued to pinch bits of modeling wax out of a
      round tin box, and to stick them all over the sketch he was modifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then he gave a twirl to the top of his working table, which
      revolved with a rusty squeak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you two unusually intelligent gentlemen ask me what good a woman the
      world&mdash;" began Quair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we don't," interrupted Guilder, in the temperate voice peculiar to
      his negative character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyway," insisted Quair, "here's what I think of 'em&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My model, yonder," said Drene, a slight shrug of contempt, "happens to be
      feminine, and may also be human. Be decent enough to defer the development
      of your rather tiresome theory."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl on the model-stand laughed outright at the rebuke, stretched her
      limbs and body, and relaxed, launching a questioning glance at Drene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right; rest a bit," said the sculptor, smearing the bit of wax he was
      pinching over the sketch before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave another twirl or two to the table, wiped his bony fingers on a
      handful of cotton waste, picked up his empty pipe, and blew into the stem,
      reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quair, one of the associated architects of the new opera, who had been
      born a gentleman and looked the perfect bounder, sauntered over to examine
      the sketch. He was still red from the rebuke he had invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guilder, his senior colleague, got up from the lounge and walked over
      also. Drene fitted the sketch into the roughly designed group, where it
      belonged, and stood aside, sucking meditatively on his empty pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right," said Guilder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quair remarked that the group seemed to lack flamboyancy. It is true,
      however, that, except for Guilder's habitual restraint, the celebrated
      firm of architects was inclined to express themselves flamboyantly, and to
      interpret Renaissance in terms of Baroque.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's some girl," added Quair, looking at the lithe, modeled figure, and
      then half turning to include the model, who had seated herself on the
      lounge, and was now gazing with interest at the composition sketched in by
      Drene for the facade of the new opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carpeaux and his eternal group&mdash;it's the murderous but inevitable
      standard of comparison," mused Drene, with a whimsical glance at the
      photograph on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carpeaux has nothing on this young lady," insisted Quair flippantly; and
      he pivoted on his heel and sat down beside the model. Once or twice the
      two others, consulting before the wax group, heard the girl's light,
      untroubled laughter behind their backs gaily responsive to Quair's wit.
      Perhaps Quair's inheritance had been humor, but to some it seemed
      perilously akin to mother-wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pockets of Guilder's loose, ill-fitting clothes bulged with linen
      tracings and rolls of blue-prints. He and Drene consulted over these for a
      while, semi-conscious of Quair's bantering voice and the girl's easily
      provoked laughter behind them. And, finally:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Guilder," said Drene briefly. And the firm of celebrated
      architects prepared to evacuate the studio&mdash;Quair exhibiting symptoms
      of incipient skylarking, in which he was said to be at his best.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drop in on me at the office some time," he suggested to the youthful
      model, in a gracious tone born of absolute self-satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For luncheon or dinner?" retorted the girl, with smiling audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may stay to breakfast also&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come on," drawled Guilder, taking his colleague's elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sculptor yawned as Quair went out: then he closed the door then
      celebrated firm of architects, and wandered back rather aimlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while he stood by the great window, watching the pigeons on
      neighboring roof. Presently he returned to his table, withdrew the dancing
      figure with its graceful, wide flung arms, set it upon the squeaky
      revolving table once more, and studied it, yawning at intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl got up from the sofa behind him, went to the model-stand, and
      mounted it. For a few moments she was busy adjusting her feet to the chalk
      marks and blocks. Finally she took the pose. She always seemed inclined to
      be more or less vocal while Drene worked; her voice, if untrained, was
      untroubled. Her singing had never bothered Drene, nor, until the last few
      days, had he even particularly noticed her blithe trilling&mdash;as a man
      a field, preoccupied, is scarcely aware of the wild birds' gay irrelevancy
      along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He happened to notice it now, and a thought passed through his mind that
      the country must be very lovely in the mild spring sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he worked, the brief visualization of young grass and the faint blue of
      skies, evoked, perhaps, by the girl's careless singing, made for his dull
      concentration subtly pleasant environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I rest?" she asked at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, if it's necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've brought my lunch. It's twelve," she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her absently, rolling a morsel of wax; then, with slight
      irritation which ended in a shrug, he motioned her to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, girls, like birds, were eternally eating. Except for that, and
      incessant preening, existence meant nothing more important to either
      species.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been busy for a few moments with the group when she said something
      to him, and he looked around from his abstraction. She was holding out
      toward him a chicken sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his mind came back from wool gathering, he curtly declined the offer,
      and, as an afterthought, bestowed upon her a wholly mechanical smile, in
      recognition of a generosity not welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you ever eat luncheon?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I?" he replied, preoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's bad for you not to. Besides, you are growing thin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that your final conclusion concerning me, Cecile?" he asked, absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you please take this sandwich?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her outstretched arm more than what she said arrested his drifting
      attention again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the devil do you want me to eat?" he inquired, fishing out his empty
      pipe and filling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You smoke too much. It's bad for you. It will do very queer things to the
      lining of your stomach if you smoke your luncheon instead of eating it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly it's so. Please take this sandwich."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking at the outstretched arm, thinking of other things and the
      girl sprang to her feet, caught his hand, opened the fingers, placed the
      sandwich on the palm, then, with a short laugh as though slightly
      disconcerted by her own audacity, she snatched the pipe from his left hand
      and tossed it upon the table. When she had reseated herself on the lounge
      beside her pasteboard box of luncheon, she became even more uncertain
      concerning the result of what she had done, and began to view with rising
      alarm the steady gray eyes that were so silently inspecting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after a moment Drene walked over to the sofa, seated himself,
      curiously scrutinized the sandwich which lay across the palm of his hand,
      then gravely tasted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This will doubtless give me indigestion," he remarked. "Why, Cecile, do
      you squander your wages on nourishment for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cost only five cents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why present five cents to me?" "I gave ten to a beggar this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was he grateful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He seemed to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This sandwich is excellent; but if I feel the worse for it, I'll not be
      very grateful to you." But he continued eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The woman tempted me,'" she quoted, glancing at him sideways.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment's survey of her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're one of those bright, saucy, pretty, inexplicable things that
      throng this town and occasionally flit through this profession&mdash;aren't
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Nobody looks for anything except mediocrity; you're one of the
      surprises. Nobody expects you; nobody can account for you, but you appear
      now and then, here and there, anywhere, even everywhere&mdash;a pretty
      sparkle against the gray monotony of life, a momentary flash like a golden
      moat afloat in sunshine&mdash;and what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then? What becomes of you? Where do you go? What do you turn into?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go somewhere, don't you? You change into something, don't you? What
      happens to you, petite Cigale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the sunshine is turned off and the snow comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, Mr. Drene." She broke her chocolate cake into halves and
      laid one on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks for further temptation," he said grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are welcome. It's good, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent. Adam liked the apple, too. But it raised hell with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, shot a direct glance at him, and began to nibble her cake,
      with her eyes still fixed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice he encountered her gaze but his own always wandered absently
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think a great deal, don't you?" she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I try not to&mdash;too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" he asked, swallowing the last morsel of cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the advantage of thinking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered her reply for a moment, her blue and rather childish eyes,
      and the very pure oval of her face. Then his attention flagged as usual&mdash;was
      wandering&mdash;when she sighed, very lightly, so that he scarcely heard
      it&mdash;merely noticed it sufficiently to conclude that, as usual, there
      was the inevitable hard luck story afloat in her vicinity, and that he
      lacked the interest to listen to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thinking," she said, "is a luxury to a tranquil mind and a punishment to
      a troubled one. So I try not to."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment or two before it occurred to him that the girl had uttered
      an unconscious epigram.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sounded like somebody&mdash;probably Montaigne. Was it?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh. Then it wasn't. You're a funny little girl, aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, rather."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On purpose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked into her very clear eyes, now brightly blue with intelligent
      perception of his not too civil badinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And sometimes," he went on, "you're funny when you don't intend to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are, too, Mr. Drene."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you know it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A dull color tinted his cheek bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said, "I didn't know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are. For instance, you don't walk; you stalk. You do what
      novelists make their gloomy heroes do&mdash;you stride. It's rather
      funny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really. And do you find my movements comic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a trifle scared, now, but she laughed her breathless, youthful
      laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are really very dramatic&mdash;a perfect story-book man. But, you
      know, sometimes they are funny when the author doesn't intend them to
      be.... Please don't be angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Why the impudence of a model should have irritated him he was at a loss to
      understand&mdash;unless there lurked under that impudence a trace of
      unflattering truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat looking at her, all at once, and in an unexpected flash of
      self-illumination, he realized that habit had made of him an actor; that
      for a while&mdash;a long while&mdash;a space of time he could not at the
      moment conveniently compute&mdash;he had been playing a role merely
      because he had become accustomed to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disaster had cast him for a part. For a long while he had been that part.
      Now he was still playing it from sheer force of habit. His tragedy had
      really become only the shadow of a memory. Already he had emerged from
      that shadow into the everyday outer world. But he had forgotten that he
      still wore a somber makeup and costume which in the sunshine might appear
      grotesque. No wonder the world thought him funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing up from a perplexed and chagrined meditation he caught her eye&mdash;and
      found it penitent, troubled, and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're quite right," he said, smiling easily and naturally; "I am
      unintentionally funny. And I really didn't know it&mdash;didn't suspect it&mdash;until
      this moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," she said quickly. "I didn't mean&mdash;I know you are often unhappy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are! Anybody can see&mdash;and you really do not seem to be very old,
      either&mdash;when you smile&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not very old," he said, amused. "I'm not unhappy, either. If I ever
      was, the truth is that I've almost forgotten by this time what it was all
      about&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman," she quoted, "between friends"&mdash;and checked herself,
      frightened that she had dared interpret Quair's malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed countenance at that; the dull red of anger clouded his visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," she faltered, "I was not saucy, only sorry.... I have been sorry for
      you so long&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who intimated to you that a woman ever played any part in my career?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's generally supposed. I don't know anything more than that. But I've
      been&mdash;sorry. Love is a very dreadful thing," she said under her
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it?" he asked, controlling a sudden desire to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not thought of it that way, recently.... I haven't thought about
      it at all&mdash;for some years.... Have you?" he added, trying to speak
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. I have thought of it," she admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you conclude it to be a rather dreadful business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know. A girl usually loves the wrong man. To be poor is
      always bad enough, but to be in love, too, is really very dreadful. It
      usually finishes us&mdash;you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you in love?" he inquired, managing to repress his amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could be. I know that much." She went to the sink, turned on the water,
      washed her hands, and stood with dripping fingers looking about for a
      towel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get you one," he said. When he brought it, she laughed and held out
      her hands to be dried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think you are a Sultana?" he inquired, draping the towel across
      her outstretched arms and leaving it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought perhaps you'd dry them," she said sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the business," he remarked; and lighted his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands were her particular beauty, soft and snowy. She was much in
      demand among painters, and had posed many times for pictures of the
      Virgin, her hands usually resting against her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she bestowed great care upon them, thoroughly drying each separate,
      slender finger. Then she pushed back the heavy masses of her hair&mdash;"a
      miracle of silk and sunshine," as Quair had whispered to her. That same
      hair, also, was very popular among painters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her figure that fascinated sculptors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you ready?" grunted Drene. Work presently recommenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was entirely accustomed to praise from men, for her general
      attractiveness, for various separate features in what really was an
      unusually lovely ensemble.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was also accustomed to flattery, to importunity, to the ordinary
      variety of masculine solicitation; to the revelation of genuine feeling,
      too, in its various modes of expression&mdash;sentimental, explosive,
      insinuating&mdash;the entire gamut.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had remained, however, untouched; curious and amused, perhaps, yet
      quite satisfied, so far, to be amused; and entirely content with her own
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She coquetted when she thought it safe; learned many things she had not
      suspected; was more cautious afterwards, but still, at intervals, ventured
      to use her attractiveness as a natural lure, as an excuse, as a reason, as
      a weapon, when the probable consequences threatened no embarrassment or
      unpleasantness for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was much liked, much admired, much attempted, and entirely untempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Make-up Club gave its annual play depicting the foibles of
      artists and writers in the public eye, Cecile White was always cast for a
      role which included singing and dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On and off for the last year or two she had posed for Drene, had dropped
      into his studio to lounge about when he had no need of her professionally,
      and when she had half an hour of idleness confronting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stood there now on the model stand, gazing dreamily from his busy
      hands to his lean, intent features, it occurred to her that this day had
      not been a sample of their usual humdrum relations. From the very
      beginning of their business relations he had remained merely her employer,
      self-centered, darkly absorbed in his work, or, when not working, bored
      and often yawning. She had never come to know him any better than when she
      first laid eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always she had been a little interested in him, a little afraid, sometimes
      venturing an innocent audacity, out of sheer curiosity concerning the
      effect on him. But never had she succeeded in stirring him to any
      expression of personal feeling in regard to herself, one way or the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably he had no personal feeling concerning her. It seemed odd to her;
      model and master thrown alone together, day after day, usually became
      friends in some degree. But there had been nothing at all of camaraderie
      in their relationship, only a colorless, professional sans-gene, the
      informality of intimacy without the kindly essence of personal interest on
      his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paid her wages promptly; said good morning when she came, and good
      night when she went; answered her questions when she asked them seriously;
      relapsed into indifference or into a lazy and not too civil badinage when
      she provoked him to it; and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never complimented her, never praised her; yet he must have thought her
      a good model, or he would not have continued to send for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think me pretty?" she had asked one day, saucily invading one of
      his yawning silences.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you're pretty good," he replied, "as a model. You'd be quite
      perfect if you were also deaf and dumb."
    </p>
    <p>
      That had been nearly a year ago. She thought of it now, a slight heat in
      her cheeks as she remembered the snub, and her almost childish amazement,
      and the hurt and offended silence which lasted all that morning, but
      which, if he noticed at all, was doubtless entirely gratifying to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I rest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it's necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang lightly to the floor walked around behind him, and stood
      looking at his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want to know my opinion?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, with unexpected urbanity; "if you are clever enough to
      have an opinion. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, looking at the wax figure of herself and speaking with
      deliberation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the last hour you have made out of a rather commonplace study an
      entirely spontaneous and charming creation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" he exclaimed, his face reddening with pleasure at her opinion, and
      with surprise at her mode of expressing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's quite true. That dancing figure is wholly charming. It is no study;
      it is pure creation."
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew it; was a little thrilled that she, representing to him an average
      and mediocre public, should recognize it so intelligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As though," she continued, "you had laid aside childish things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" he asked, surprised again at the authority of the expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Academic precision and the respectable excellencies of-the-usual;&mdash;you
      have put away childish things and become a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you hear that?" he said bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard it when I said it. You know, Mr. Drene, I am not wholly
      uneducated, although your amiable question insinuates as much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not unamiable. Only I didn't suppose&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you never have supposed anything concerning me. So why are you
      surprised when I express myself with fragmentary intelligence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me. I'm not afraid of you any more. I've been afraid for two
      years. Now, I'm not. Your study is masterly. I know it. You know it. You
      didn't know I knew it; you didn't know I knew anything. And you didn't
      care."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on the sofa, facing him with a breathless smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't care what I think, what I am, what interests I may have, what
      intellect, what of human desire, hope, fear, ambition animates me; do you?
      You don't care whether I am ignorant or educated, bad or good, ill or well&mdash;as
      long as it does not affect my posing for you; whether I am happy or
      unhappy, whether I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For Heaven's sake&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you don't care!... Do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent; he stood looking at her in a stupid sort of way.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment or two she rose, picked up her hat, went to the glass and
      pinned it on, then strolled slowly back, drawing on her gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's five o'clock, you know, Drene."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want me to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Yes, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not offended?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer. She came up to him and repeated the question in a
      childishly anxious voice that was a trifle too humble. And looking down
      into her eyes he saw a gleam of pure mischief in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You little villain!" he said; and caught her wrists. "A lot you care
      whether I am offended!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked away from him, turning her profile. Her expression was
      inscrutable. After a silence he dropped her wrists with a vague laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should have let me alone," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The woman tempted me,'" she repeated, still looking away from him. He
      said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night," she nodded, and turned toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went with her, falling into step beside her. One arm slipped around her
      waist as they entered the hallway. They walked slowly to the door. He
      unlatched it, hesitated; she moved one foot forward, and he took a step at
      the same time which brought her across his path so closely that contact
      was unavoidable. And he kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," she said. "So you are human after all! I often wondered."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, trying to laugh, but could not seem to take it as coolly as
      she might have wished to.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that a kiss is very important in these days," she continued, "yet it
      might interest you to hear that a friend of yours rather fancies me. He
      wouldn't like you to do it. But&mdash;" She lifted her blue eyes with
      faint malice&mdash;"What is a woman between friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack Graylock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene remained motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't encouraged him," she said. "Perhaps that is why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why he fancies you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why he asked me to marry him. It was the only thing he had not asked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He asked that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "After he realized it was the only way, I suppose," she said coolly. Drene
      took her into his arms and kissed her deliberately on the mouth. Looking
      up at him she said: "After all, he is your friend, isn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend of many years. But, as you say, what is a woman between
      friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said the girl. And, still clasped in his arms, she bent
      her head, thoughtfully, considering the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as though she had come to some final conclusion, she raised her head,
      lifted her eyes slowly, and her lips, to the man whose arms enfolded her.
      It was her answer to his question, and her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone, he went back and stood again by the great window,
      watching the cote on a neighboring roof, where the pigeons were strutting
      and coquetting in the last rays of the western sun.

    <p>
      When she came again to the studio, she was different, subdued, evading,
      avoiding, smiling a little in her flushed diffidence at his gay ease of
      manner&mdash;or assumption of both ease and gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was inclined to rally her, tease her, but her reticence was not all
      embarrassment. The lightest contact, the slightest caress from him, added
      a seriousness to her face, making it very lovely under its heightened
      color, and strangely childlike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Model and master they would have remained no longer had it been for him to
      say, he desiring now to make it a favor and concession on her part to aid
      him professionally, she gravely insisting on professionalism as the basis
      of whatever entente might develop between them, as well as the only avowed
      excuse for her presence there alone with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please. It's respectable," she insisted her agreeable, modulated voice.
      "I had rather the reason for my coming here be business&mdash;whatever
      else happens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened," he said, balancing a handful of wet clay in one hand
      and looking laughingly up at her, where she stood on the model-stand, "is
      that a pretty girl strolled in here one day and held up a mirror to a
      solemn ass who was stalking theatrically through life. That solemn ass is
      very grateful for the glimpse he had of himself. He behaved gratefully,
      didn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very," she said with a forced smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you object to the manner in which he expressed his gratitude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while she raised her eyes, her head still lowered. He was working,
      darkly absorbed as usual in the plastic mass under his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him curiously, not his hands, now, but his lean, intent face,
      striving to penetrate that masculine mask, trying to understand. Varying
      and odd reflections and emotions possessed her in turn, and passed&mdash;wonder,
      bewilderment at herself, at him; a slight sense of fear, then a brief and
      sudden access of shyness, succeeded by the by glow of an emotion new and
      strange and deep. And this, in turn, by vague bewilderment again, in which
      there was both a hint of fear, and a tinge of something exquisite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within herself she was dimly conscious that a certain gaiety, an
      irresponsibility and lightness had died out in her, perhaps permanently,
      yet leaving no void. What it was that replaced these she could not name&mdash;she
      only was conscious that if these had been subdued by a newer knowledge,
      with a newer seriousness, this unaccustomed gravity had left her heart no
      less tender, and had deepened her capacity for emotion to depths as
      profound and unexplored as the sudden mystery of their discovery by
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always, now, while she posed, she was looking at him with a still
      intentness, as though he really wore a mask and she, breathlessly
      vigilant, watched for the moment when he might forget and lift it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during the weeks that followed, if the mask were indeed only the
      steady preoccupation that his visage wore, she seemed to learn nothing
      more about him when his features lost their dark absorption and he caught
      her eye and smiled. No, the smile revealed nothing except another mask
      under the more serious cast of concentration&mdash;only another disguise
      that covered whatever this man might truly be deeper down&mdash;this
      masculine and unknown invader of frontiers surrendered ere she had
      understood they were even besieged.
    </p>
    <p>
      And during these weeks in early spring their characteristics, even
      characters, seemed to have shifted curiously and become reversed; his was
      now the light, irresponsible, half-mocking badinage&mdash;almost boyishly
      boisterous at times, as, for instance, when he stepped forward after the
      pose and swung her laughingly from the model-platform to her corner on the
      sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You pretty and clever little thing," he said, "why are you becoming so
      serious and absent-minded?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I becoming so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are. You oughtn't to: you've made a new and completely different man
      of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      As though that were an admirable achievement, or even of any particular
      importance. And yet she seemed to think it was both of these when, resting
      against him, within the circle of his arm, still shy and silent under the
      breathless poignancy of an emotion which ever seemed to sound within her
      depths unsuspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he said that she had made a new and completely different man of
      him, she remembered his low-voiced when that change impended as he held
      her by her wrists a moment, then dropped them. He had said, half to
      himself: "You should have let me alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes at noon she remembered this when they went out for luncheon
      realizing they would never have been seated together in a restaurant had
      she not satisfied her curiosity. She should have let him alone; she knew
      that. She tried to wish that she had&mdash;tried to regret everything,
      anything; and could not, even when within her the faint sense of alarm
      awoke amid the softly unchangeable unreality of these last six weeks of
      spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this then really love?&mdash;this drifting through alternating dreams
      of shyness, tenderness, suspense, pierced at moments by tiny flashes of
      fear, as lightning flickers, far buried in softly shrouded depths of
      cloud?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had long periods of silent and absorbed dreaming, conscious only that
      she dreamed, but not of the dream itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware, too, of a curious loneliness within her, and dimly
      understood that it was the companion of a lifetime she was missing&mdash;her
      conscience. Where was it? Had it gone? Had it died? Were the little,
      inexplicable flashes of fear proof of its disintegration? Or its immortal
      vitality?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead, dormant, departed, she knew not which, she was dully aware of its
      loss&mdash;dimly and childishly troubled that she could remember nothing
      to be sorry for. And there was so much.

    <p>
      Men in his profession who knew him began to look askance at him and her,
      amused or otherwise, according to their individual characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Cecile White went about more or less with the sculptor Drene was a
      nine days' gossip among circles familiar to them both, and was forgotten&mdash;as
      are all wonders&mdash;in nine days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of his acquaintances recalled what had been supposed to be the
      tragedy of his life, mentioning a woman's name, and a man's&mdash;Drene's
      closest friend. But gossip does not last long among the busy&mdash;not
      that the busy are incapable of gossip, but they finish with it quickly,
      having other matters to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Quair, after recovering from his wonder that his own condescending
      advances had been ignored, bestowed his fatuously inflammable attentions
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been inclined to complain one day in the studio, when he and
      Guilder visited Drene professionally; and Guilder looked at his dapper
      confrere in surprise and slight disgust; and Drene, at first bored, grew
      irritable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you talking about?" he said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm talking about Cecile White," continued Quair, looking rather oddly at
      the sculptor out of his slightly prominent eyes. "I didn't suppose you
      could be interested in any woman&mdash;not that I mind your interfering
      with any little affair between Cecile and me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There wasn't any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, Drene&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There wasn't any!" repeated Drene, with curt contempt. "Don't talk about
      her, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean I'm not to talk about a common artist's model&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh. Is she yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She isn't anybody's, I fancy. Therefore, let her alone, or I'll throw you
      out of doors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quair said to Guilder after they had departed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fancy old Drene playing about with that girl on a strictly pious basis!
      He's doubtless dub enough to waste his time. But what's in it for her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps a little unaccustomed masculine decency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody is decent enough to her as far as I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Including yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, including myself," retorted Quair, adding naively: "Besides, I
      knew any attempt at philandering would be time wasted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you tried it," mused Guilder, entering his big touring car and
      depositing a bundle of blue-prints and linen tracing paper at his own
      ponderous feet. Quair followed him and spoke briefly to the chauffeur,
      then:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tried nothing," he said. "A little chaff, that's all. When it comes to a
      man like Jack Graylock going so far as to ask her to marry him, good
      night, nurse! Nothing doing, even for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even for you," repeated Guilder in his moderate and always modulated
      voice. "Well, if she's escaped you and Graylock, she's beyond any danger
      from Drene, I fancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quair smiled appreciatively, as though a delicate compliment had been
      offered him. Several times on the way to call on Graylock he insisted on
      stopping the car at as many celebrated cafes. Guilder patiently awaited
      him in the car and each time Quair emerged from the cafe bar a little more
      flushed and a trifle jauntier than when he had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man so perfectly attired and so scrupulously fastidious about his
      person that Guilder often speculated as to just why Quair always seemed to
      him a trifle soiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, looking him over as he climbed into the car, unusually red in the
      face, breathing out the aroma of spirits through his little, pinched
      nostrils, a faint sensation of disgust came over the senior member of the
      firm as though the junior member were physically unclean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's about ten drinks since luncheon," he remarked, as the car rolled
      on down Fifth Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quair, who usually grew disagreeably familiar when mellow, poked his
      gloved thumb:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a merry old cock, aren't you?" he inquired genially, "&mdash;like
      a pig's wrist! If I hadn't the drinking of the entire firm to do, who'd
      ever talk about Guilder and Quair, architects?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was common rumor that Quair did his brilliant work only when "soused."
      And he never appeared to be perfectly sober, even when he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graylock received them in his office&mdash;a big, reckless-eyed, handsome
      man, with Broad Street written all over him and "danger" etched in every
      deepened line of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, how about that business of mine?" he inquired. "It's all right to
      keep me waiting, of course, while you and Quair here match for highballs
      at the Ritz."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had to see Drene&mdash;that's why we are late," explained Guilder.
      "We're ready to go ahead and let your contracts for you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drene?" interrupted Graylock, looking straight at Guilder with a curious
      and staring intensity. "Why drag Drene into an excuse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because we went to his studio," said Guilder. "Now about letting the
      contracts&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you at Drene's studio?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He's doing the groups for the new opera for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quair, watching Graylock, was seized with a malicious impulse:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neat little skirt he has up there&mdash;that White girl," he remarked,
      seating himself on Graylock's polished table.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dull flush stained Graylock's cheekbones, and his keen eyes turned on
      Quair. The latter lighted a cigarette, expelled the smoke in two thin
      streams from his abnormally narrow nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some skirt," he repeated. "And it looks as though old Drene had her
      number&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Guilder's level voice interrupted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The contracts are ready to be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Graylock, not heeding, and perhaps not hearing, and looking all the
      time at Quair, said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drene isn't that kind.... Is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our kind, you mean?" inquired Quair, with a malice so buried under
      flippancy that the deliberate effrontery passed for it with Graylock.
      Which amused Quair for a moment, but the satisfaction was not sufficient.
      He desired that Graylock should feel the gaff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drene," he said, "is one of those fussers who jellify when hurled on
      their necks&mdash;the kind that ask that kind of girl to marry them after
      she's turned down everything else they suggest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Graylock's square jaw tightened and his steady eyes seemed to grow even
      paler; but Quair, as though perfectly unconscious of this man's record
      with the wife of his closest friend, and of the rumors which connected him
      so seriously with Cecile White, swung his leg unconcernedly, where it
      dangled over the table's edge, and smiled frankly and knowingly upon
      Graylock:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's always somebody to marry that sort of girl; all mush isn't on the
      breakfast table. When you and I are ready to quit, Graylock, Providence
      has created a species of man who settles our bills."
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw back his head, inhaled the smoke of his cigarette, sent two thin
      streams through his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe Drene may marry her himself. But&mdash;I don't believe he'll have
      to.... Now, about those contracts&mdash;" he affected a yawn, "&mdash;go
      on and tell him, Guilder," he added, his words distorted by another yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped down to the floor from his perch on the table, stretched his
      arms, looking affably all the while at Graylock, who had never moved a
      muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you had a run-in with that Cecile girl once, didn't you,
      Graylock? Like the rest of us, eh? Oh, well&mdash;my hat off to old Drene
      if he wins out. I hold no malice. After all, Graylock, what's a woman
      between friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he nodded gaily at Graylock and sauntered leisurely to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      And kept his back turned, fearful of exploding with laughter in the very
      face of the man who had been staring at him out of pale, unchanging eyes
      so steadily and so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guilder's patient, bored, but moderate voice was raised once more:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In regard to the letting of these contracts&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Graylock, staring at Quair's back, neither heeded nor heard him, for
      his brain was still ringing with the mockery of Quair's words&mdash;"What
      is a woman between friends?" And now, for the first time, he was beginning
      to understand what the answer might be.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      She had not posed for Drene during the last two weeks, and he had begun to
      miss her, after his own fashion&mdash;that is, he thought of her when not
      preoccupied and sometimes desired her companionship when unoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      And one evening he went to his desk, rummaged among note-books, and
      scribbled sheets of paper, until he found her address, which he could
      never remember, wrote it down on another slip of paper, pocketed it, and
      went out to his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he dined, other matters reoccupied his mind, matters professional,
      schemes little and great, broad and in detail, which gradually, though not
      excluding her entirely, quenched his desire to see her at that particular
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes it was sheer disinclination to make an effort to communicate
      with her, sometimes, and usually, the self-centering concentration which
      included himself and his career, as well as his work, seemed to obliterate
      even any memory of her existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then, when alone in his shabby bedroom, reading a dull book, or
      duly preparing to retire, far in the dim recesses of heart and brain a
      faint pain became apparent&mdash;if it could still be called pain, this
      vague ghost of anger stirring in the ashes of dead years&mdash;and at such
      moments he thought of Graylock, and of another; and the partly paralyzed
      emotion, which memory of these two evoked, stirred him finally to think of
      Cecile.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at such times that he always determined to seek her the next day
      and continue with her what had been begun&mdash;an intimacy which depended
      upon his own will; a destiny for her which instinct whispered was within
      his own control. But the next day found him at work; models of various
      types, ages, and degrees of stupidity came, posed, were paid, and
      departed; his studies for the groups in collaboration with Guilder and
      Quair were approaching the intensely interesting period&mdash;that stage
      of completion where composition has been determined upon and the
      excitement of developing the construction and the technical charm of
      modeling begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      And evening always found him physically tired and mentally satisfied&mdash;or
      perturbed&mdash;to the exclusion of such minor interests as life is made
      of&mdash;dress, amusement, food, women. Between a man and a beloved
      profession in full shock of embrace there is no real room for these or
      thought of these.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate irregularly and worked with the lack of wisdom characteristic of
      creative ability, and he grew thinner and grayer at the temples, and
      grayer of flesh, too, so that within a month, between the torrid New York
      summer and his own unwisdom, he became again the gaunt, silent, darkly
      absorbed recluse, never even stirring abroad for air until some
      half-deadened pang of hunger, or the heavy warning of a headache, set him
      in reluctant motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard of Cecile now and then; Cosby had used her for a figure on a
      fountain destined to embellish the estate of a wealthy young man somewhere
      or other; Greer employed her for the central figure of Innocence in his
      lovely and springlike decoration for some Western public edifice. Quair
      had met her several times at Manhattan Beach with various and assorted
      wealthy young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      And one evening Guilder came alone to his studio and found him lying on
      the lounge, his lank, muscular hands, still clay-stained, hanging inert to
      the floor above an evening paper fallen there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Guilder," he said, without rising, as the big architect shambled
      loosely through the open doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, Drene?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. It's hot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's not a breath of air. It looks like a thunder-storm in the west."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled up a chair and sprawled on it, wiping his grave features with a
      damp handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drene," he said, "a philanthropic guy of sorts wants to add a chapel to
      the church at Shallow Brook, Long Island. We've pinched the job. Can you
      do an altar piece?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They want a Virgin. It's to be called the Chapel of the Annunciation.
      It's for women to repair to&mdash;under certain and natural
      circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've so much on hand&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's only a single figure-barring the dove. Why don't you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are plenty of other men&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They want you. There'll be no difficulty about terms."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene said with a shrug:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terms are coming to mean less and less to me, Guilder. It costs very
      little for me to live." He turned his gray, tired face. "Look at this barn
      of a place; and go in there and look at my bedroom. I have no use for what
      are known as necessities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, terms are terms&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. A truck may run over me. Even at that, I've enough to live life
      out as I am living it here&mdash;between these empty walls&mdash;and that
      expanse of glass overhead. That's about all life holds for me&mdash;a
      sheet of glass and four empty walls&mdash;and a fistfull of wet clay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you a trifle morbid, Drene?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not by any means; I merely prefer to live this way. I have sufficient
      means to live otherwise if I wish. But this is enough of the world to suit
      me, Guilder&mdash;and I can go to a noisy restaurant to eat in when I'm so
      inclined&mdash;" He laughed a rather mirthless laugh and glanced up,
      catching a peculiar expression in Guilder's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're thinking," said Drene coolly, "what a god I once set up on the
      altar of domesticity. I used to talk a lot once, didn't I?&mdash;a hell of
      a clamor I made in eulogy of the domestic virtues. Well, only idiots
      retain the same opinions longer than twenty-four hours. Fixity is
      imbecility; the inconstant alone progress; dissatisfaction is only a
      synonym for intelligence; contentment translated means stagnation..... I
      have changed my opinion concerning the virtues of domesticity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Guilder said, in his even, moderate voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your logic is weird, Drene: in one breath you say you have changed your
      opinion; in another that you are content; in another that contentment is
      the fixedness of imbecility&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene, reddening slightly, half rose on one elbow from his couch:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I meant was that I change in my convictions from day to day, without
      reproaching myself with inconstancy. What I believed with all my heart to
      be sacred yesterday I find a barrier to-day; and push it aside and go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toward what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I go on, that's all I know&mdash;toward sanctuary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean professionally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In every way&mdash;ethically&mdash;spiritually. The gods of yesterday,
      too, were very real&mdash;yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drene, a man may change and progress on his way toward what never
      changes. But standards remained fixed. They were there in the beginning;
      they are immutable. If they shifted, humanity could have no goal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there a goal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In your profession there is a goal toward which you sculptors all
      journey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfection?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Guilder nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," smiled Drene, "no two sculptors ever see it alike."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is still Perfection. It is still the goal to the color-blind and
      normal alike, whatever they call it, however, they visualize it. That is
      its only importance; it is The Goal..... In things spiritual the same
      obtains&mdash;whether one's vision embraces Nirvana, or the Algonquin
      Ocean of Light, or a pallid Christ half hidden in floating clouds&mdash;Drene,
      it is all one, all one. It is not the Goal that changes; only our
      intelligence concerning its existence and its immortality."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene lay looking at him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never knew pain&mdash;real pain, did you? The world never ended for
      you, did it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In one manner or another we all must be reborn before we can progress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a cant phrase."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; there's truth under the cant. Under all the sleek, smooth, canty
      phrases of ecclesiastic proverb, precept, axiom, and lore, there is truth
      worth the sifting out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are welcome to think so, Guilder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You also could come to no other conclusion if you took the trouble to
      investigate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene smiled:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morals are no more than folk-ways&mdash;merely mental condition
      consequent upon custom. Spiritual beliefs are radically dependant upon
      folkways and the resultant physical and mental condition of the human
      brain which creates everything that has been and that is to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Physiology has proven that no idea, no thought, ever originated within
      the concrete and physical brain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've read of those experiments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you can't ignore a conclusion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't reached a conclusion. Meanwhile, I have my own beliefs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all that's necessary," said Guilder, gravely, "&mdash;to entertain
      some belief, temporary or final." He smiled slightly down at Drene's
      drawn, gray visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and I have been friends of many years, Drene, but we have never
      before talked this way. I did not feel at liberty to assume any intimacy
      with you, even when I wanted to, even when&mdash;when you were in trouble&mdash;"
      He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on," grunted the other. "I'm out of trouble now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just&mdash;it's a whimsical notion&mdash;no, it's a belief;&mdash;I
      just wanted to tell you one or two things concerning my own beliefs&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Temporary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. It doesn't matter; they are beliefs. And this is one: all
      physical and mental ills are created only by our own minds&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christian Science?" sneered Drene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call it what you like," said Guilder serenely. "And call this what you
      like: All who believe worthily will find that particular belief true in
      every detail after death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you call that?" demanded Drene, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows. It seems to be my interpretation of the Goal. I seem to be
      journeying toward it without more obstacles and more embarrassments to
      encounter than confront the wayfarer who professes any other creed."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while Drene sat up on his couch:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did all this conversation start?" he asked uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was about the Virgin for that chapel we are going to do..... That's
      part of my belief: those who pray for her intercession will find her after
      death, interceding&mdash;" he smiled, "&mdash;if any intercession be
      necessary between us and Him who made us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And those unlisted millions who importune Mohammed and Buddha?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shall find Mohammed and Buddha, who importune them worthily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;Christ?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He bears that name also&mdash;He!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! And so, spiritually as well as artistically, you believe in the
      Virgin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You also can make a better Virgin if you believe in her otherwise than
      esthetically."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene gazed at him incredulously, then, with a shrug:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do you want this thing started?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't take it on now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want a sketch pretty soon&mdash;the composition. You can have a model
      of the chapel to&mdash;morrow. We went on with it as a speculation. Now
      we've clinched the thing. When shall I send it up from the office?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll look it over, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," interrupted Guilder, "you had better get that Miss White for the
      Virgin&mdash;before she goes off somewhere out of reach."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene looked up somberly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't kept in touch with her. I don't know what her engagements may
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of her engagements just now seems to be to go about with Graylock,"
      said Guilder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene flushed, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he marries her," added Guilder, "as it's generally understood he is
      trying to, the best sculptor's model in town is out of the question.
      Better secure her now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wants to marry her?" repeated Drene, in a curiously still voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's mad about her. He's abject. It's no secret among his friends. Men
      like that&mdash;and of that age&mdash;sometimes arrive at such a terminal&mdash;men
      with Graylock's record sometimes get theirs. She has given him a run,
      believe me, and he's brought up with a crash against a stone wall. He is
      lying there all doubled up at her feet like a rabbit with a broken back.
      There was nothing left for him to do but lie there. He's lying there
      still, with one of her little feet on his bull neck. All the town knows
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wants to marry her," repeated Drene, as though to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She may not take him at that. They're queer&mdash;some women. I suppose
      she'd jump at it if she were not straight. But there's another thing&mdash;"
      Guilder looked curiously at Drene. "Some people think she's rather crazy
      about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene gazed into space.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that wouldn't hurt her," added Guilder, in his calm, pleasant voice.
      "She's a straight little thing&mdash;white and straight. She could come to
      no harm through a man like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene continued to stare at space.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So," continued the other, confident, "when she recovers from a natural
      and childlike infatuation for you she'll marry somebody... Possibly even
      such a man as Graylock might make her happy. You can't ever tell about
      such men at the eleventh hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene turned his eyes on him. There was no trace of color in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you pretty damned charitable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charitable? Well, I&mdash;I'm so inclined, I fancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd be content to see that girl marry a dog like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say so. I am no judge of men. No man knows enough to condemn
      souls."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene looked at him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll tell you something. I know enough to do it. I had rather damn
      my soul&mdash;and hers, too&mdash;than see her marry the man you have
      named. It would be worth it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a strained silence, Guilder said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a mode of dealing with those who have injured you, which is
      radically different&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I deal with such people in my own fashion!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, after all, the infamy is Graylock's. Why oblige him by sharing it
      with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know what he did to me and mine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few of us know," said Guilder, gently, "&mdash;your old friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a pale, infernal flicker into Drene's eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take your commission for that altar piece," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it? An Annunciation?"
    </p>

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Composition had been determined upon, and the sketch completed by the
      middle of August; Cecile had sat for him every day from nine until five;
      every evening they had dined together at the seashore or other suburban
      and cool resorts. Together they had seen every summer entertainment in
      town, had spent the cooler, starlit evenings together in his studio,
      chatting, reading loud sometimes, sometimes discussing he work in hand or
      other subjects of he moment, even topics covering a wider and more varied
      range than he had ever before discussed with any woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have become utterly changed; the dark preoccupation had been
      absent from his face&mdash;the gauntness, the grayness, seemed to have
      become subdued; the deep lines of pain, imperceptible at times, smoothed
      out and shadowed in an almost gay resurgence of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, during the first week or two of her companionship, his gaiety had been
      not entirely spontaneous, his smile shadowed with something duller, his
      laughter a trifle forced, she had not perceived it in her surprised and
      shyly troubled preoccupation with this amazing and delightful
      transfiguration.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she scarcely knew what to look for, what to expect from him, from
      herself, when she came into the studio after many weeks of absence; and
      she always halted in the doorway, trembling a little, as always, when in
      contact with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was very delightful, smiling, easy, and deferential enough to
      reassure her with a greeting that became him, as he saluted her pretty
      hand, held it a moment in possession, laughingly, and released it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment of their reunion he had never touched her, save for a
      quick, firm, smiling hand-clasp in the morning and another at the night's
      parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, little by little, she was finding herself delightfully at ease with
      him, emerging by degrees from her charming bewilderment out of isolation
      to a happy companionship never before shared with any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor even vaguely had she dreamed that Drene could be such a man, such a
      friend, never had she imagined there was in him such kindness, such
      patience, such gentleness, such comprehension, such virile sense and
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And never, now, was her troubled consciousness aware of anything
      disquieting in his attitude, of anything to perturb her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to enjoy himself like a boy, with her companionship, wholly,
      heartily, without any motive other than the pleasure of the moment; and
      so, little by little, she gave herself up to it too, in the same fashion,
      unguardedly, frankly, innocently revealing herself to him by degrees as
      their comradeship became deliciously unembarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was making a full length study in clay now. All day long she sat there
      enthroned, her eyes partly closed, the head lifted a trifle and fallen
      back, and her lovely hands resting on her heart&mdash;and sometimes she
      strove to imagine something of the divine moment which she was embodying;
      pondering, dreaming, wondering; and sometimes, in the stillness, through
      her trance crept a thrill, subtle, exquisite, as though in faint
      perception of the heavenly moment. And once, into her half-dreaming senses
      came the soft stirring of wings, and she opened her eyes and looked up,
      startled and thrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was only a pigeon which had come through the great window from the
      cote on the adjacent roof and which circled above her on whimpering wings
      for a moment and then sheered out into the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dined together at a roof garden that evening, the music was
      particularly and surprisingly good, and what surprised him even more was
      that she knew it and spoke of it. And continued speaking of music, he not
      interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reticent hitherto concerning her antecedents he learned now something of
      them&mdash;and inferred more; nothing unusual&mdash;a musical career
      determined upon, death intervening dragging over her isolation the steel
      meshes of destitution&mdash;the necessity for self-support, a friend who
      knew a painter who employed models&mdash;not anything unusual, not even
      dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded as she ended:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you saved anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hundred dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's fine."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, then sighed unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are thinking," he said, "that youth is flying."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Youth is the time to study. You were thinking that, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could have married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" she asked, troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To obtain the means for a musical education."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him in amazement, then: "I could go out on the street, too,
      as far as that is concerned. It would be no more disgraceful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Folk-ways sanction self-sale, when guaranteed by the clergy," he said.
      She turned her head and he saw the pure, cold profile against the golden
      table-lamp, and he saw something else under the palms beyond&mdash;Graylock's
      light eyes riveted upon them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know," he said, under his breath, "that I shall not marry you. But&mdash;would
      you care to begin your studies again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence: She remained with face partly averted until the
      orchestra ceased. Then she turned and looked at him, and he saw her lip
      tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had not thought you meant to ask me&mdash;that. I do not quite
      understand what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care enough for you to wish to help you. May I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not sure you cared&mdash;enough&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you&mdash;for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before I say that I do&mdash;care for you&mdash;" she began, tremulously&mdash;"tell
      me that I have nothing to fear&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke. Over her shoulder Drene stared at the distant man who
      stared back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently his eyes reverted to hers, absently studying the childlike
      beauty of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to tell you something," he said. "Love is no more wonderful
      than hate, no more perfect, no more eternal. And it is less fierce, and
      not as strong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" she whispered, bewildered at the sinister change in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I want to tell you another thing. I am alone in the world. What I
      have, I have devised to you&mdash;in case I step out&mdash;suddenly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, hesitated, then:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Also I desire you to hear something else," he went on. "This is the
      proper time for you to hear it, I think&mdash;now&mdash;to-night&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his blazing eyes and looked at the other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a woman," he said&mdash;"She happened to be my wife. Also there
      was my closest friend: and myself. The comedy was cast. Afterward she died&mdash;abroad.
      I believe he was there at the time&mdash;Kept up a semblance&mdash;But he
      never married her.... And I do not intend to marry&mdash;you."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment: "And that," she whispered, "is why you once said to me
      that I should have let you alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I say that to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." She looked up at him, straight into his eyes: "But if you care for
      me&mdash;I do not regret that I did not let you alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not marry you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lip trembled but she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is nothing new to me," she said. "Only one man has offered that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you take him?" he asked, with an ugly laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't. I cared for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," he said, "are you afraid of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned forward suddenly, "You'd better steer clear of me!" Her startled
      eyes beheld in him a change as swift as his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair warning!" he added: "look out for yourself." Everything that was
      brutal in him; everything ruthless and violent had marred his features so
      that all in a moment the mouth had grown ugly and a hard, bruised look
      stamped the pallid muscles of his features and twitched at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're taking chances from now on," he said. "I told you once to let me
      alone. You'd better do it now. And&mdash;" he stared at the distant man&mdash;"I
      told you that hate is more vital than love. It is. I've waited a long time
      to strike. Even now it isn't in me to do it as I have meant to do it. And
      so I tell you to keep away from me; and I'll strike in the old-fashioned
      way, and end it&mdash;to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stunned by his sudden and dreadful metamorphosis, her ears ringing with
      his disjointed incoherencies, she rose, scarcely knowing what she was
      doing, scarcely conscious that he was beside her, moving lightly and in
      silence out into the brilliant darkness of the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only at her own door that he spoke again: standing there on the
      shabby steps of her boarding-house, the light from the transom yellowing
      his ghastly face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something snapped"&mdash;he passed an unsteady hand across his eyes;&mdash;"I
      care very deeply for you. I&mdash;they'll make over to you&mdash;what I
      have. You can study on it&mdash;live on it, modestly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "W-what is the matter? Are you ill?" she stammered, white and frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he only muttered that she had her warning and that she should keep
      away from him, and that it would not be long before she should have an
      opportunity in life. And he went his way not looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached his studio the hall was dark. As he turned the key he
      thought he heard something stirring in the shadows, but went in&mdash;leaving
      the door into the hallway open&mdash;and straight on across the room to
      his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was putting something into his coat pocket, and his back was still
      turned to the open door when Graylock stepped quietly across the
      threshold; and Drene heard him, but closed his desk, leisurely, and then,
      as leisurely, turned, knowing who had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they stood alone together after many years.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      Graylock looked at Drene's heavily sagging pocket and knew what was in it.
      A sudden sweat chilled his temples, but he said steadily enough:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to say a word or two&mdash;if you'll give me time." And, as
      Drene made no reply;&mdash;"You're quite right: This business of ours
      should be finished one way or another. I can't stand it any longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," remarked Drene with an evil stare at him, "I may postpone
      it&mdash;to find out how much you can stand." He dropped his right hand
      into the sagging pocket, looking intently at Graylock all the while:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want here anyway?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy that you have already guessed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe. All the same, what do you want?"&mdash;fumbling with his bulging
      pocket for a moment and then remaining motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graylock's worn eyes rested on the outline of the shrouded weapon: he
      stood eyeing it absently for a moment, then seated himself on the sofa,
      his heavy eyes shifting from one object to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were few objects to be seen in that silent place;&mdash;a star
      overhead glimmering through the high expanse of glass above;&mdash;otherwise
      gray monotony of wall, a clay shape or two swathed in wet clothes, a
      narrow ring of lamp light, and formless shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a long time, Drene."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene mused in silence, now and then watching the other obliquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he withdrew his right hand from his coat pocket, pulled an
      armchair toward him and seated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's many years," repeated Graylock. "I expected you to do something
      before this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you uneasy?" sneered Drene. Then he shrugged, knowing that Graylock
      was no coward, sorry he had intimated as much, like a man who deals a
      premature and useless blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat brooding for a while, his lean dangerous head lowered sideways as
      though listening; his oblique glance always covering Graylock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you'll be surprised when I tell you one reason that I came
      here," said Graylock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you suppose you can still surprise me by anything you may say or do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man remained silent, sitting with his hands tightly clasped on his
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drene," he said, in a low voice, "don't strike at me through this young
      girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene began to laugh, unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you in love with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes.... You know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene said, still laughing: "It's the common rumor. You may imagine it
      amuses your friends&mdash;if you have any left."
    </p>
    <p>
      Graylock spoke in a voice that had a ghostly sound in the great room:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't harm her, Drene. It is not necessary. I shall never see her again&mdash;if
      that will content you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene laughed: "I never saw my wife again. Did that help me? I never saw
      her again, but as long as she lived I knew what she was ... My wife. And
      when she died, still my wife. There was no relief&mdash;no relief."
    </p>
    <p>
      Graylock, deathly white, framed his haggard face between his hands and
      stared at nothing:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," he said. "I understand now. I am here to-night to pay the
      reckoning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't pay it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not the whole score. There's another bill, I suppose, waiting for me&mdash;somewhere.
      But I can settle my indebtedness to you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's up to you, Drene."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?" repeated Drene, violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graylock made a slight gesture with his head toward Drene's sagging
      pocket: "That way if you like. Or," he added, "There is a harder
      punishment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To give her up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Drene, "that is harder. But I can make it even harder than
      that. I can make it as hard for you as you made it for me. I can let you
      live through it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, fisted in his pocket, drew out the lumpy automatic and
      leisurely pushed the lever to "safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "To kill you would be like opening the cell door for a lifer. You
      know what you are while you're alive; maybe you'd forget if you were dead.
      I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased, fiddling absently with the dull-colored weapon on his knee; and
      for a while they remained silent, not looking at each other. And when
      Drene spoke again he was still intent upon the automatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I knew what happens after a man dies I could act intelligently." He
      shot an ugly look at Graylock: "I don't know about you, either. You're a
      rat. But you might fool me at that. You might be repentant. And in that
      case you'd get away&mdash;if it's true that the eleventh hour is not too
      late.... If it's true that Christ is merciful.... So I'll take no chances
      of a getaway. You might fool me&mdash;one way or another&mdash;if you were
      dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Graylock lifted his head from his hands: "I don't know how much of the
      other debt I've already paid, Drene. But I've paid heavily since I knew
      her&mdash;if that is any satisfaction to you. And since I knew she cared
      for you, and when I realized that you meant to strike me through her&mdash;I
      have paid, heavily.... Yet, if you were honestly in love with her&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that any of your damned business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's only a child&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You rat! That's what's coming to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you say so. But what is coming to her, Drene?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Continue to guess. But I know you. It's yourself you're sorry for and
      what you'll have to endure&mdash;live through. That's what you can't
      stand, and remain the sleek, self-satisfied rat you are. No, it will make
      earth a living hell for you; never a second, day or night, will you be
      able to forget&mdash;if you really do love her.... And I believe you do&mdash;I
      don't understand how a thing like you can love&mdash;but it seems it can."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence Graylock said: "You don't care if you damn yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's worth it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you willing that I should know you are as great a blackguard as I
      am?" Drene's gaunt features reddened and he set his jaws in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you care what you do to her?" asked Graylock, unsteadily. "It's a
      viler business than that for which you are punishing me."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time Drene sat there looking down at the weapon on his knees.
      And after a while, the other man spoke huskily: "It's bad enough either
      way for me, Drene. I'll do what you wish in the matter. I'll leave the
      country; I'll stay; whichever you say. Or," he said with a ghastly smile,
      "I'll clean out that automatic for you to-night&mdash;if you'll marry
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene looked up, slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said that I'd clean out your automatic for you&mdash;to-night&mdash;if
      you wish.... It can be an accident or not, just as you say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my own rooms&mdash;if it is to be an accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you offer&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; if you'll marry her afterwards. If you say you will I'll take your
      word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then you'll be out of your misery, you damned coward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows.... But I think not," said Graylock, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene twisted the automatic, rose and continued to twirl it, considering.
      Presently he began to pace the floor, no longer noticing the other man.
      Once his promenade brought him up facing the wall where a calendar hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a while looking at it absently. After a few moments he
      stepped nearer, detached the sheet for the present month, then one by one
      tore off the remaining sheets until he came to the month marked December,
      Graylock watching him all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it happened on Christmas," remarked Drene turning toward the
      other and laying a finger on the number 25 printed in red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graylock's head bent slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Suppose about eleven o'clock on Christmas night you give your
      automatic a thorough cleaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall buy one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you come here armed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene looked at him very intently. But Graylock had never been a liar.
      After a few moments he went over to his desk, replaced the weapon under
      the papers, and, still busy, said over his shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. You can go."

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      He wrote to Cecile once:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hereafter keep clear of men like Graylock and like me. We're both of a
      stripe&mdash;the same sort under our skins. I've known him all my life. It
      all depends upon the opportunity, the circumstances, and the woman. And,
      what is a woman between friends&mdash;between such friends as Graylock and
      I once were&mdash;or between the sort of friends we have now become? Keep
      clear of such men as we are. We were boys together.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week or two he kept his door locked and lived on what the janitor
      provided for him, never going out of the studio at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did no work, although there were several unexecuted commissions
      awaiting his attention and a number of sketches, clay studies, and one
      marble standing around the studio in various stages of progress. The
      marble was the Annunciation. The head and throat and slender hands were
      completed, and one slim naked foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he wandered from one study to the next, vague-eyed, standing for
      a long time before each, staring, lost in thought. Sometimes, in the
      evening he read, choosing a book at random among the motley collection in
      a corner case&mdash;a dusty, soiled assortment of books, ephemeral novels
      of the moment, ponderous volumes which are in everybody's library but
      which nobody reads, sets of histories, memoirs, essays, beautifully bound
      and once cared for, but now dirty from neglect&mdash;jetsam from a wrecked
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a time when law, order and neatness formed the basis of
      Drene's going forth and coming in. He had been exact, precise, fastidious;
      he had been sensitive to environment, a lover of beautiful things, a man
      who deeply appreciated any symbol that suggested home and hearth and
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when these three were shattered in the twinkling of an eye, something
      else broke, too. And he gradually emerged from chaos, indifferent to all
      that had formerly been a part of him, a silent emotionless, burnt out
      thing, callous to all that he had once cared for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet something of what he had been must have remained latent within him for
      with unimpaired precision and logic he constructed his clay and chiseled
      his marble; and there must have been in him something to express, for the
      beauty of his work, spiritual and material, had set him high among the
      highest in his profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes sorrow changes the dross from the lamp of the spirit so that it
      burns with a purity almost unearthly; sometimes sorrow sears, rendering
      the very soul insensible; and sometimes sorrow remains under the ashes, a
      living coal steadily consuming all that is noble, hardening all that is
      ignoble; and is extinguished leaving a devil behind it&mdash;fully
      equipped to slay the crippled soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone in his studio at night, motionless in his chair, Drene was becoming
      aware of this devil. Reading by lamplight he grew conscious of it;
      recognized it as a companion of many years, now understanding that
      although pain had ended, hatred had remained, hiding, biding, and very,
      very quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly this hatred had flamed like hell-fire, amazing even himself&mdash;that
      day when, lifted out of his indifference for an instant by a young girl's
      gaiety&mdash;and with a smile, half-responsive, on his own unaccustomed
      lips, he had learned from her in the same instant, that the man he had
      almost ceased to remember was honestly in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he knew that he hated and that he should strike, and that
      there could be no comparison in perfection between hatred and what perhaps
      was love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, at night, lying on the studio couch, he found himself still
      hesitating. Could Graylock be reached after death? Was it possible? If he
      broke his word after Graylock was dead could he still strike and reach him
      through the woman for whose sake he, Graylock, was going to step out of
      things?
    </p>
    <p>
      That occupied his mind continually, now. Was there anybody who could tell
      him about such matters? Did clergymen really know whether the soul
      survived? And if it did, and if truly there were a hell, could a living
      man add anything to its torments for his enemy's benefit?
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the janitor, lingering, ventured to ask Drene whether he was
      feeling quite well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes" said Drene, "I am well."
    </p>
    <p>
      The janitor spoke of his not eating. And, as Drene said nothing, he
      mentioned the fact that Drene had not set foot outside his own quarters in
      many weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene nodded: "I expect to go for a walk this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not. He lay on his couch, eyes open in the darkness, wondering
      what Graylock was doing, how he lived, what occupied his days.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were the nights of a condemned man like? Did Graylock sleep? Did he
      suffer? Was the suspense a living death to him? Had he ever suspected him,
      Drene, of treachery after he, Graylock, had fulfilled his final part of
      the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time, now, a fierce curiosity concerning what Graylock was
      thinking and doing had possessed Drene. What does a man, who is in good
      physical health, do, when he is at liberty to compute to the very second
      how many seconds of life remain for him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene's sick brain ached with the problem day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In November the snow fell. Drene had not been out except in imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day, in imagination, he had followed Graylock, night after
      night, slyly, stealthily, shirking after him through busy avenues at
      midday, lurking by shadowy houses at midnight, burning to see what
      expression this man wore, what was imprinted on his features;&mdash;obsessed
      by a desire to learn what he might be thinking&mdash;with death drawing
      nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Drene, in the body, had never stirred from his own chilly room&mdash;a
      gaunt, fierce-eyed thing, unkempt, half-clothed, huddled all day in his
      chair brooding above his bitten nails, or flung starkly across his couch
      at night staring at the stars through the dirty crust of glass above.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night in December when the stars were all staring steadily back at
      him, and his thoughts were out somewhere in the darkness following his
      enemy, he heard somebody laughing in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while he lay very still, listening; but when he realized that the
      laughter was his own he sat up, pressing his temples between hot and
      trembling fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to silence the laughter: terror subsided to a tremulous
      apprehension&mdash;as though he had been on the verge of something
      horrible sinking into it for a moment&mdash;but had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he found himself thinking of Graylock, and presently he laughed;
      then frightened, checked himself. But his fevered brain had been afire too
      long; he lay fighting with his thoughts to hold them in leash lest they
      slip out into the night like blood hounds on the trail of the man they had
      dogged so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling, terrified, he set his teeth in his bleeding lip, and clenched
      his gaunt fists: He could not hold his thoughts in leash; could not
      control the terrifying laughter; hatred blazed like hell-fire scorching
      the soul in him, searing his aching brain with flames which destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness he struggled blindly to his feet; and he saw the stars
      through the glass roof all ablaze in the midnight sky; saw the infernal
      flicker of pale flames in the obscurity around him, heard a voice calling
      for help&mdash;his own voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something stirred in the darkness; he listened, stared, striving to
      pierce the obscurity with fevered eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long since the cloths that swathed the clay figures in the studio had
      dried out unnoticed by him. He gazed from one to another, holding his
      breath. Then his eyes rested upon the altar piece, fell on the snowy foot,
      were lifted inch by inch along the marble folds upward slowly to the slim
      and child-like hands&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, God!" he whispered, knowing he had gone mad at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, under the carven fingers, the marble folds of the robe over the heart
      were faintly glowing from some inward radiance. And, as he reeled forward
      and dropped at the altar foot, lifting his burning eyes, he saw the
      child-like head bend toward him from the slender neck&mdash;saw that the
      eyes were faintly blue&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother of God!" he screamed, "my mind is dying&mdash;my mind is dying!
      ... We were boys, he and I.... Let God judge him.... Let him be judged...
      mercifully.... I am worse than he.... There is no hell. I have striven to
      fashion one&mdash;I have desired to send him thither&mdash;Mother of God&mdash;Cecile&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Under his fevered eyes he was confusing them, now, and he sank down close
      against the pedestal and laid his f ace against her small cold foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sick," he rambled on&mdash;"and very tired.... We were boys
      together, Cecile.... When I am in my right mind I would not harm him....
      He was so handsome and daring. There was nothing he dared not do.... So
      young, and straight, and daring.... I would not harm him. Or you,
      Cecile.... Only I am sick, burning out, with only a crippled mind left&mdash;from
      being badly hurt&mdash;It never got well. ... And now it is dying of its
      hurt&mdash;Cecile!&mdash;Mother of God!&mdash;before it dies I do forgive
      him&mdash;and ask forgiveness&mdash;for Christ's sake&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward noon the janitor broke in the door.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late in December before Drene opened his eyes in his right senses.
      He unclosed them languidly, gazed at the footboard of his bed, then,
      around at the four shabby walls of his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cecile?" he said, distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl who had been watching him laid aside her sewing, rose, and bent
      over him. Suddenly her pale face flushed and one hand flew to her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest?" he said, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then down on her knees fell the girl, and groped for his wasted hand and
      laid her cheek on it, crying silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Drene, he lay there, his hollow eyes roaming from wall to wall. At
      last he turned his head on the pillow and looked down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day when he opened his eyes from a light sleep his skin was moist
      and cool and he managed to move his hand toward hers as she bent over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want&mdash;Graylock," he whispered. The girl flushed, bent nearer,
      gazing at him intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Graylock," he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not now," she murmured, "not today. Rest for a while."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please," he said, looking up at her trustfully&mdash;"Graylock. Now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you are well&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am&mdash;well. Please, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while she continued sitting there on the side of his bed, his limp
      hands in hers, her lips pressed against them. But he never took his eyes
      from her, and in them she saw only the same wistful expression,
      unchanging, trustful that she would do his bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      So at last she went into the studio and wrote a note to Graylock. It was
      late. She went downstairs to the janitor's quarters where there was a
      messenger call. But no messenger came probably Christmas day kept them
      busy. Perhaps, too, some portion of the holiday was permitted them, for it
      was long after dinner and the full tide of gaiety in town was doubtless at
      its flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she waited until it was plain that no messenger was coming; then she
      rose from the chair and stood gazing out into the wintry darkness through
      the dirty basement window. Clocks were striking eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she turned to go her eye fell upon the telephone. She hesitated. But
      the memory of Drene's eyes, their wistfulness and trust decided her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little waiting she got Graylock's apartment. A servant asked her
      to hold the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an interval she recognized Graylock's voice at the telephone,
      pleasant, courteous, serenely wishing her the happiness of the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing this Christmas night?" she asked. "Surely you are not
      all alone there at home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am rather too old for anything else," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what are you doing? Reading?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact," he said, "I happened to be cleaning an automatic
      revolver when you called up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a gay employment for Christmas night! Is that your idea of
      celebrating?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There happens to be nothing else for me to do tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there is. You are requested to make a call."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On whom?" he asked, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Mr. Drene."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a full minute he remained silent, although she spoke to him twice,
      thinking the connection might have been interrupted. Then his voice came,
      curiously altered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who asked that of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Drene."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Drene is very ill, I hear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is convalescent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he ask you to call me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;you are with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In his apartment. I came downstairs to the janitor's rooms. I am
      telephoning from there what he wished me to ask you."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause Graylock said: "Is his mind perfectly clear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly, now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He asked for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Will you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He asked for me? Tonight? At eleven o'clock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "I don't think he knows even what month it is. He has only been
      conscious for a day or two. Had he known it was Christmas night perhaps he
      might not have disturbed you. But&mdash;will you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid it is too late&mdash;to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tomorrow, then? Shall I tell him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. She repeated the question. But Graylock's reply was
      inaudible and she thought he said good-bye instead of good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the rear of the basement the janitor and his family and
      probably all his relatives were celebrating. A fiddle squeaked in there;
      there was a steady tumult of voices and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood a while listening, a slight smile on her lips. Blessed
      happiness had come to her in time for Christmas&mdash;a strange and
      heavenly happiness, more wonderful than when a life is spared to one who
      loves, for it had been more than the mere life of this man she had asked
      of God: it had been his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay asleep when she entered and stood by the shaded lamp, looking down
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while she seated herself and took up her sewing. But laid it aside
      again as there came a low knocking at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene opened his eyes as Graylock entered all alone and stood still beside
      the bed looking down at him. In the studio Cecile moved about singing
      under her breath. They both heard her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drene nodded weakly. After a moment he made the effort to speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am trying to get well&mdash;to start again&mdash;better&mdash;live more&mdash;nobly.
      ... Take your chance, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you wish, Drene."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I was not&mdash;very&mdash;well. I had been ill&mdash;very&mdash;a
      long while ... And you are not to clean the automatic.... Only your
      own-soul.... Ask help.... You'll get it..... I did.... And&mdash;all that
      is true&mdash;what we believed&mdash;as boys.... I know. I've seen. And
      it's all true&mdash;all true&mdash;what we believed&mdash;as little boys."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at Graylock, then closed his eyes with the shadow of a smile
      in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye&mdash;Jack," he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graylock's mouth quivered, his lips moved in speech; and perhaps Drene
      heard and understood, for he opened his eyes and looked once more at his
      boyhood friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somewhere&mdash;somebody will straighten out&mdash;all this," he
      murmured, closing his eyes again: "We can't; we can only try&mdash;to
      straighten out&mdash;ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Graylock looked down at him in silence, then, tall and heavily erect, he
      turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecile met him from the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night," she said, offering her hand.... "And a happy Christmas.... I
      hope you will not be lonely."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand, gravely, thanked her, and went his way forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes she lingered in the doorway connecting Drene's bedroom
      with the studio. She held a sprig of holly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little while he opened his eyes and looked at her, and, smiling,
      she came forward to the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a terrible dream," he whispered&mdash;"all those years. But it was
      a dream."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must dream no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Come nearer."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rested on the bed's edge beside him and laid one hand on his. The
      other held the holly, but he did not notice it until she offered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear," she whispered, "it is Christmas night. And you did not even know
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the tears he had not known for years burned in his eyes, and he
      closed them, trembling, awed by the mercy of God that had been vouchsafed
      to him at the eleventh hour, else he had slain his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he felt her lips touching his brow. And now silent in the
      spell of the dream that invaded her&mdash;the exquisite vision of wifehood&mdash;she
      sat motionless with childlike eyes lost in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more he turned his head and looked at her. Then her slender neck
      bent, and he saw that her eyes were divinely blue&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cecile!"&mdash;he faltered&mdash;"Madonna inviolate!... The woman&mdash;between&mdash;friends&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
